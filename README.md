## Introduction

Cryptopals is a collection of cryptography challenges that cover a wide range of topics in the field. These challenges are a great way to learn about cryptographic algorithms, their applications, and their weaknesses. This repository aims to provide solutions to all the challenges, along with explanations and relevant code.

## Challenges

The challenges are divided into several sets. Each set contains multiple challenges that build upon the concepts learned in the previous ones. You can find the details of all challenges on the [Cryptopals website](https://cryptopals.com/).

## How to Use

Each challenge solution is provided in its respective directory under the `challenges` folder. The solutions are implemented in Go and can be run individually. To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding challenge directory and execute the Go script.

For example, to run the solution for Set 1, Challenge 1:

```sh
cd challenges/set1
go run solutions.go
```

## Dependencies

The solutions are implemented in Go. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Some challenges may require additional libraries or packages, which will be specified in the respective directories.

To install Go on your system, follow the instructions on the official Go website.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution or find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the coding style used in the repository and provide clear commit messages.
